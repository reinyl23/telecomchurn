The dataset can be found thru this link: https://www.mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-churn-challenge/6

I created this dashboard to enhance my skilsl in creating dashboards using Power BI.

"For this challenge, you'll be assuming the role of a BI Consultant for Maven Communications, a California-based Telecommunications company. You've been hired to help the company improve retention by identifying high value customers and churn risks, and have been asked to present your findings to the CMO in the form of a single page report or dashboard."
